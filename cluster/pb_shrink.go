// ISR SHRINK driver (primary-driven, meta-leader-committed, floor-
// enforced). GROW is a separate, deferred increment.
//
// A full-ISR write stalls forever on a dead backup (ErrPipelineStalled): commit
// requires EVERY ISR member to ack, and a dead member never does. The primary has
// the freshest signal for this (its engine's per-peer replication-failure
// counter), so — exactly like the 4b liveness beacon — the shrink is PRIMARY-
// driven: the primary detects the wedge, asks the meta leader to commit a smaller
// ISR (never below minISR), then, once it observes that committed shrink in its
// own MetaFSM, calls Engine.ShrinkISR to live-re-evaluate the in-flight writes so
// the stalled pipeline resumes — provably without losing any acked write (the
// no-acked-loss / no-false-commit proofs live on Engine.ShrinkISR).
//
// THE minISR FLOOR IS ENFORCED HERE. OpSetShardISR's FSM apply is epoch-guarded
// but does NOT check minISR (meta_fsm.go), so a shrink that would drop the ISR
// below the durability floor must be refused by THIS driver — the shard then
// stays stalled (H3: choose unavailability over durability loss). decidePBShrink
// is the pure, floor-enforcing decision; pbShrinkDriver.tick is its plumbing.

// pbShrinkRequest is a decided ISR shrink: at epoch, set shard's ISR to newISR
// (the current ISR minus the confirmed-dead members). The caller commits it via
// OpSetShardISR (epoch-guarded so a fenced ex-primary's stale request is a no-op).
