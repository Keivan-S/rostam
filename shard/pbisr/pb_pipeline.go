// ============================================================================
// ISR SHRINK (live in-flight re-evaluation). GROW is a separate,
// deferred increment; nothing below ever WIDENS a required set.
// ============================================================================
//
// THE CRUX (live-ISR re-eval rule, proven): an in-flight write W(epoch=E, seq=s)
// may drop a required member M and commit against the smaller set S' IFF the
// engine has observed a MetaRaft-COMMITTED shrink to S' (M ∉ S') at the CURRENT
// epoch E, held under a still-valid lease for E, BEFORE the sweep's commit
// decision. ShrinkISR is that observation point. The drop is:
//
//   - MONOTONE-NARROWING: a required set only ever loses members, never gains
//     one. Grow (widening in-flight records) is unsound and explicitly NOT done
//     here — the asymmetry is load-bearing for the proofs below.
//   - EPOCH-SCOPED: the override (effISR/effISREpoch) is cleared on every epoch
//     advance, so a shrink decided for E can never narrow an E+1 write.
//
// PROOF — NO ACKED-LOSS. Suppose W commits after ShrinkISR narrowed it to S'.
// P6 (unchanged) still requires EVERY member of the record's propose-time
// EFFECTIVE required set to have acked (epoch,s); after narrowing that set is
// S'\{primary}, all of which acked, and the primary applied W locally. So every
// member of S' holds W at the moment of commit. ShrinkISR is only ever called
// AFTER OpSetShardISR(E,S') is MetaRaft-committed (the driver observes it in the
// local MetaFSM first), so the authoritative ISR at E is S'. A 4b failover picks
// the new primary FROM that committed ISR (⊆ S'), and every member of S' holds
// every W that committed under it. Hence no client-acked write can be lost. ∎
//
// PROOF — NO FALSE COMMIT. The drop is gated on an OBSERVED committed shrink; it
// never invents durability. After narrowing, the remaining required members
// S'\{primary} must STILL each ack (removePending only drops the removed M, not a
// live member), and the driver refuses any shrink that would take |S'| below
// minISR, so a commit still rests on ≥ minISR nodes. The commit-time lease fence
// in sweepLocked is UNTOUCHED (OH1/Q5 preserved): a fenced primary still cannot
// commit even after a narrowing. ∎
//
// THE STALE-READ RACE (why two halves are required). proposeSequenced snapshots
// ctrl.ISR OUTSIDE any lock. A Propose that captured a PRE-shrink ISR could
// register the removed M into a NEW record after ShrinkISR's narrowing pass ran
// — re-wedging the pipeline. Closing it needs BOTH:
//   (1) ShrinkISR narrows every ALREADY-registered in-flight record (below), and
//   (2) proposeSequenced intersects its stale snapshot with the live override
//       (engine.go, the effISREpoch==epoch branch).
// Both the override install here and the intersect there run under e.mu, so for
// any record either the intersect sees the override (drops M at registration) or
// this narrowing pass sees the record (drops M after registration) — no window.

// ShrinkISR installs a MetaRaft-committed ISR shrink to newISR for epoch, live
// re-evaluating every in-flight write of that epoch so a stalled pipeline can
// commit against the smaller set without losing any acked write. It is the
// engine-side landing point for a committed OpSetShardISR(epoch, newISR); the
// control-plane driver calls it only AFTER observing that op committed in the
// local MetaFSM, and only when |newISR| >= minISR (the floor is the DRIVER's
// responsibility — the FSM does not enforce it).
//
// It is a NO-OP unless the shrink is for the engine's CURRENT epoch AND this node
// still holds that epoch's lease (epoch == e.epoch && e.leaseEpoch == epoch): a
// stale-epoch shrink, or one arriving after this node was fenced, must not touch
