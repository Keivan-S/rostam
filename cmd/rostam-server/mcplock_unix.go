// believe they own them, which corrupts the store rather than failing. There is

// refused up front.

// also take it are held off) and released automatically by the kernel if this
// process dies without closing the file — a crash must not leave a data dir
// permanently unopenable. It is also per-open-file-description, so it does NOT
// protect against the same process opening the dir twice; that isn't a case
